    "$$  (𝜇_{1},𝜇_{2},𝜇_{3}.....𝜇_{n}) $$\n",

    "    3.2) F-Statistic :- The statistic which measures the extent of difference between the means of different samples or how significantly the means differ is called the F-statistic or F-Ratio. It gives us a ratio of the effect we are measuring (in the numerator) and the variation associated with the effect (in the denominator). The formula given to calculate the F-Ratio is: \n",

    "    \n",
    "    There are variations among the individual groups as well as within the group. This gives rise to the two terms: Within-group variability and Between-group variability. \n",

    "    ii) On the other hand, when there are variations in the sample distribution within an individual group, it is called Within-group variability. \n",

    "<b> Types of ANOVA Test </b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    One-Way ANOVA :- One-way ANOVA is generally the most used method of performing the ANOVA test. It is also referred to as one-factor ANOVA, between-subjects ANOVA, and an independent factor ANOVA. It is used to compare the means of two independent groups using the F-distribution. \n",
    "    Two carry out the one-way ANOVA test, you should necessarily have only one independent variable with at least two levels. One-way ANOVA does not differ much from t-test. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example where one-way ANOVA is used\n",
    "    Suppose a teacher wants to know how good he has been in teaching with the students. So, he can split the students of the class into different groups and assign different projects related to the topics taught to them. \n",
    "    He can use one-way ANOVA to compare the average score of each group. He can get a rough understanding of topics to teach again. However, he won’t be able to identify the student who could not understand the topic. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The steps to perform the one way ANOVA test are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 1: Calculate the mean for each group.\n",
    "    Step 2: Calculate the total mean. This is done by adding all the means and dividing it by the total number of means.\n",
    "    Step 3: Calculate the SSB.\n",
    "    Step 4: Calculate the between groups degrees of freedom.\n",
    "    Step 5: Calculate the SSE.\n",
    "    Step 6: Calculate the degrees of freedom of errors.\n",
    "    Step 7: Determine the MSB and the MSE.\n",
    "    Step 8: Find the f test statistic.\n",
    "    Step 9: Using the f table for the specified level of significance, α, find the critical value. This is given by F(α, df1. df2).\n",
    "    Step 10: If f > F then reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two-way ANOVA :-Two-way ANOVA is carried out when you have two independent variables. It is an extension of one-way ANOVA. You can use the two-way ANOVA test when your experiment has a quantitative outcome and there are two independent variables. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Two-way ANOVA is performed in two ways:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    i) Two-way ANOVA with replication: It is performed when there are two groups and the members of these groups are doing more than one thing. Suppose, there is a group of patients who are suffering from fever. They are being given three different medicines that have the same functionality i.e. to cure fever. To understand the effectiveness of each medicine and choose the best among them, the ANOVA test is used. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii) Two-way ANOVA without replication: This is used when you have only one group but you are double-testing that group. For example, a patient is being observed before and after medication. \n",
